As a child, I loved standing in front of a computer and trying different things on it. By the age of 14, I was building some small games and even making a bit of pocket money for my troubles.

Today, I’m still doing what I love. As a computer sciences student, I am working hard to obtain my bachelor degree in this field and to continue my path to become a computing engineer.

Successes achieved during my time in this role include:

When I’m not working on my computer, I’m either spending time at the gym or reading some books to invest in my self.
